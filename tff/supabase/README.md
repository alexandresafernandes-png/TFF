# TFF — Supabase

## Status

**Schema: defined. `/checklist`, `/shopping`, `/routines`, `/protocols`, user notes on `/protocols` + `/bloodwork`, and the dashboard personal summary are wired. All other pages: localStorage only.**

- `/checklist` syncs completions and custom items to Supabase when the user is logged in
- `/shopping` syncs retainer checkmarks, upgrade status, and custom items to Supabase when the user is logged in
- `/routines` syncs active/completed today state to Supabase when the user is logged in
- `/protocols` syncs protocol tracking status and notes to Supabase when the user is logged in; protocol content remains static JSON
- `/protocols` (per-protocol) and `/bloodwork` (per-marker) support personal notes via `UserNotesPanel`, synced to `user_notes` when signed in
- `/` (dashboard) shows a personal summary card when signed in: today's checklist count, protocol tracking counts, today's routine counts, shopping checked counts, and last 3 notes; falls back to a "local-first mode" prompt when not signed in
- All other app pages still use `localStorage` exclusively
- Route protection is **active** — all `app/(app)` routes require a signed-in session; unauthenticated requests redirect to `/login`
- Public routes: `/login` and `/auth/callback` — no session required
- Auth boundary is implemented in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` using `supabase.auth.getUser()` server-side; middleware is intentionally not used for auth
- `localStorage` remains an internal fallback for all synced pages when Supabase data is unavailable, but app access now requires login
- Auth UX is polished: login page shows "already signed in" state when revisited, `/settings` Account section shows live session status via `AuthSessionStatus`, dashboard CTA links to `/login`
- Primary login method is **email + password** (`signInWithPassword`). Magic link is available as a secondary fallback via "Send magic link instead". Requires the Supabase user to have a password set.

## Phase 1.5 sync status

| Feature | localStorage | Cloud sync | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Checklist completions | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | Daily scope; remote wins on merge |
| Checklist custom items | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | `client_id` bridge for cross-device match |
| Shopping retainer status | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | checked / unchecked per item |
| Shopping upgrade status | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | planned / bought / unchecked per item |
| Shopping custom items | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | `client_id` bridge; mode = retainer \| upgrade |
| Routine completions | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | Daily scope; active / done / inactive |
| Protocol tracking | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | Not date-scoped; one row per protocol per user |
| Personal notes | ✓ primary | ✓ when signed in | Soft-delete via `is_archived`; area + entity_id scoped |
| Dashboard summary | — | Read-only fetch | `Promise.allSettled`; partial failure safe |
| Auth | — | Magic link | No route enforcement |
| Route protection | — | Active | `app/(app)/layout.tsx` redirects to `/login`; middleware not used |
| localStorage fallback | ✓ always | — | Active on all synced pages regardless of auth state |

## Running the migrations

No Supabase CLI is required. Run migrations manually:

1. Open your Supabase project → **SQL Editor**
2. Run `001_initial_tff_schema.sql` first
3. Run `002_tff_user_data_schema.sql` second
4. Run `003_checklist_client_id.sql` third
5. Run `004_shopping_client_id.sql` fourth
6. Run `005_user_notes_archive.sql` fifth
7. Run `006_daily_progress_snapshots.sql` sixth

Each file is idempotent: re-running it is safe (`create table if not exists`, `create or replace function`, `drop trigger if exists` before recreating, etc.).

---

## Migration index

### `001_initial_tff_schema.sql` — Phase 1 foundation

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `profiles` | Per-user profile (id = auth.uid(), display_name, email, avatar_url) |
| `user_settings` | Flexible key/value preferences per user |
| `checklist_completions` | Daily checklist completion state per item |
| `shopping_status` | Bought/planned/skipped state for shopping items |
| `active_protocols` | Which protocols a user has started/ended |
| `personal_notes` | Freeform notes attached to any entity |
| `user_day_state` | Flexible per-day JSON state blob |

Also includes: `handle_updated_at()` trigger function, storage bucket instructions.

---

### `003_checklist_client_id.sql` — Phase 1.5 Step 4

Adds `client_id text` to `checklist_custom_items`. This maps local `c_<timestamp>_<random>` IDs to Supabase UUIDs so the sync layer can match remote rows to local items without changing the local ID format. Sparse index on `client_id where client_id is not null`.

---

### `004_shopping_client_id.sql` — Phase 1.5 Step 5

Adds `client_id text` to `shopping_custom_items`. This maps local `custom_retainer_<timestamp>_<random>` and `custom_upgrade_<timestamp>_<random>` IDs to Supabase UUIDs, using the same client_id bridge pattern as migration 003. Sparse index on `client_id where client_id is not null`.

---

### `006_daily_progress_snapshots.sql` — Phase 2 Step 2

Creates `daily_progress_snapshots`. One row per user per calendar day. Captures score, checklist/routine/protocol counts, and a `metrics jsonb` field for future expansion. `unique(user_id, progress_date)` makes upsert safe to call on every `/progress` load.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `progress_date` | date | Local date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `score` | numeric | 0–100, computed by `calcScore()` in progress-sync.ts |
| `checklist_completed` | integer | Items completed today |
| `checklist_total` | integer | Always 21 (denominator) |
| `routines_completed` | integer | Routines with status=done |
| `routines_active` | integer | Routines with status=active |
| `protocols_active` | integer | Protocols with status=active |
| `protocols_completed` | integer | Protocols with status=completed |
| `notes_count` | integer | Notes updated today |
| `metrics` | jsonb | Reserved for future fields |

---

### `005_user_notes_archive.sql` — Phase 1.5 Step 8

Adds `is_archived boolean not null default false` to `user_notes`. This enables soft-delete: notes are hidden from fetch queries (`eq("is_archived", false)`) rather than permanently deleted. Partial index on `(user_id, area) where is_archived = false` for fast per-area lookups. Required before using `archiveUserNote()` in `lib/supabase/notes-sync.ts`.

---

### `002_tff_user_data_schema.sql` — Phase 1.5 user data schema

| Table | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `checklist_custom_items` | User-created checklist items (not in JSON data) | New in 002 |
| `shopping_custom_items` | User-created shopping items per basket mode | New in 002 |
| `shopping_item_status` | Bought/checked state with retainer/upgrade mode split | Supersedes `shopping_status` from 001 |
| `routine_completions` | Per-day routine active/done state | New in 002 |
| `protocol_tracking` | Active protocols with status text + notes | Supersedes `active_protocols` from 001 |
| `user_notes` | Notes with title, area, entity link | Supersedes `personal_notes` from 001 |

Also included in 002:
- `set_updated_at()` trigger function (canonical alias for `handle_updated_at()`)
- `handle_new_user()` function + `on_auth_user_created` trigger — auto-creates a `profiles` row on sign-up
- `ALTER TABLE checklist_completions` — adds `item_source`, `completed`, `updated_at` columns
- Performance indexes on all user-owned tables

## Table reference

### Tables covered by 001 (use these in Phase 2 wiring)

**`profiles`** — User profile. `id` = auth user UUID (not a foreign key column, it IS the PK).
```
id            uuid  PK  references auth.users(id)
email         text
display_name  text
avatar_url    text
created_at    timestamptz
updated_at    timestamptz
```
> Covers the `user_profiles` spec. RLS: `id = auth.uid()`.

**`user_settings`** — Per-user key/value preferences.
```
id          uuid  PK
user_id     uuid  FK → auth.users
key         text

updated_at  timestamptz
UNIQUE (user_id, key)
```
> Covers the `user_app_settings` spec. Column names differ from spec (`key`/`value` vs `setting_key`/`setting_value`) — use the 001 names when wiring Phase 2.

---

## RLS summary

All user tables use owner-only RLS via `for all` policies:

```sql
using  (auth.uid() = user_id)
with check (auth.uid() = user_id)
```

For `profiles`: `auth.uid() = id` (id IS the user UUID).

No row is readable, writable, or deletable by anyone other than the owning user. Service-role key bypasses RLS — only use it server-side for admin operations.

---

## Superseded tables

These tables from 001 are left intact but should not be targeted by Phase 2 wiring:

| 001 table | Superseded by | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `shopping_status` | `shopping_item_status` | Missing `mode` column for retainer/upgrade split |
| `active_protocols` | `protocol_tracking` | Uses `active boolean` instead of `status text`; no notes field |
| `personal_notes` | `user_notes` | Column names (`entity_type`, `content`) differ from Phase 2 spec |

---

## Phase 2 — Active

### Phase 2 Step 1 — Daily Progress (complete)
- `/progress` reads `checklist_completions`, `routine_completions`, `protocol_tracking`, and `user_notes` (today's notes) via `lib/supabase/progress-sync.ts`.
- Score formula: `min(completedToday/21, 1) × 70 + min(doneToday × 5, 20) + (active > 0 ? 10 : 0)`. Denominator 21 = actual checklist item count across 7 groups.

### Phase 2 Step 4 — Active Protocol System v2 (complete)
- `/protocols` enhanced with an Active Protocol Summary section at the top of the page.
- No new tables — uses existing `protocol_tracking` table and `lib/supabase/protocols-sync.ts`.
- Summary shows: Active / Paused / Completed / Not Started counts plus a "Currently Active" list.
- Currently Active list: shows each active protocol's name, category, days since start, and quick Pause / Complete / View actions.
- Each protocol detail now shows a Tracking Overview block: status badge, days-since-start, started/ended dates, and a "Duration target: manual review needed" note (no duration field in protocol data).
- `handleStatusChange` timestamp rules: Active → sets `started_at` if unset, clears `ended_at`; Completed → sets `ended_at`; Paused → preserves both; Not Active → preserves notes, no data loss.
- Adherence tracking placeholder added with TODO comment in protocol detail (Phase 2.x, not implemented).
- localStorage fallback and local-first mode unchanged. Daily Progress score formula unchanged.

### Phase 2 Step 3 — Weekly Review (complete)
- `/weekly-review` reads from `daily_progress_snapshots` — no new tables required.
- Sections: Weekly Score Summary, Consistency Breakdown, Last 7 Days, Weekly Insight.
- Score threshold ≥ 70 = successful day (same as streak engine).
- Weekly Score Summary: average score, successful days, days tracked, best day, weakest day.
- Consistency Breakdown: checklist %, routine completion rate, protocol active-days, notes total.
- Last 7 Days: per-day row showing score, success/fail, and breakdown from snapshot columns.
- Weekly Insight: 2–4 objective factual summaries from the data — no recommendations or advice.
- Navigation: Sidebar (key W), MobileMoreSheet, Topbar crumb, and dashboard Quick Actions.

### Phase 2 Step 2 — Streak Engine / Daily History (complete)
- `/progress` now upserts a `daily_progress_snapshots` row on every page load (fire-and-forget background write).
- The unique constraint `(user_id, progress_date)` prevents duplicates — upsert is safe to call on every visit.
- Streak logic: **current streak** = consecutive days ending today if today ≥ 70, otherwise consecutive days ending yesterday (preserves streak while today is in progress); **best streak** = longest such run in fetched history; **missed day** = no snapshot OR score < 70.
- Success threshold: **score ≥ 70** (visible in UI as "STREAK DAY = DAILY EXECUTION SCORE ≥ 70").
- `/progress` shows: current streak · best streak · 7-day average · days tracked · last 7 days mini history.
- Phase 2.5: trend charts and weekly analytics will build on these snapshots.
